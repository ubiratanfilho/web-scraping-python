    "**When to get_text() and When to Preserve Tags**\n",
    "\n",
    " .get_text() strips all tags from the document you are working with and returns a Unicode string containing the text only. For example, if you are working with a large block of text that contains many hyperlinks, paragraphs, and other tags, all those will be stripped away, and you’ll be left with a tagless block of text. Keep in mind that it’s much easier to find what you’re looking for in a BeautifulSoup object than in a block of text. Calling .get_text() should always be the last thing you do, immediately before you print, store, or manipulate your final data. In general, you should try to preserve the tag structure of a document as long as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "## find() and find_all() functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Probably the two most used functions in BeautifulSoup. They are extremely similar. Let`s look at their arguments?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "find_all(tag, attributes, recursive, text, limit, keywords)\n",
    "find(tag, attributes, recursive, text, keywords)\n",
    "\n",
    "- tag: all tags you want to search - `.find_all(['h1', 'h2'])`\n",
    "- attributes: takes a dictionary of attributes and matches tags that contain any one of those attributes `.find_all('span', {'class':{'green', 'red'}})`\n",
    "- recursive: if True, finds all children and children's children for tags that match your parameters.\n",
    "- text: looks for similar text content\n",
    "- limit: is used only in find_all method to limit the number of tags found\n",
    "- id: select tags that contain a particular attribute - `find_all(id='title')`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Other BS objects\n",
    "So far in the book, you’ve seen two types of objects in the BeautifulSoup library: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- BeautifulSoup objects: Instances seen in previous code examples as the variable bs \n",
    "- Tag objects: Retrieved in lists, or retrieved individually by calling find and find_all on a BeautifulSoup object, or drilling down, as follows: bs.div.h1 \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are two more objects in the library that, although less commonly used, are still important to know about: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- NavigableString objects: Used to represent text within tags, rather than the tags themselves (some functions operate on and produce NavigableStrings, rather than tag objects). \n",
    "- Comment object Used to find HTML comments in comment tags, <!--like this one-->.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Navigating through trees\n",
    "\n",
    "The find_all function is responsible for finding tags based on their name and attributes. But what if you need to find a tag based on its location in a document? That’s where tree navigation comes in handy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Difference between children and descendants\n",
    "- **Children**: a line below their parents\n",
    "- **Descendants**: one or more lines below the parents\n",
    "\n",
    "BeautifulSoup funcions always deal with the descendants of the current tag selected. For instance, bs.body.h1 selects the first h1 tag that is descendant of the body tag. If you want to find only descendants that are children, you can use the `.children` tag:"
